Welcome to my LeetCode Grind! 🚀
This repository tracks my journey to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms by solving handpicked problems across core topics like Arrays, Linked Lists, Two Pointers, and more.

📅 Goal
✅ Solve 1–3 curated LeetCode problems daily

✅ Master patterns like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Linked Lists, Sorting, etc.

✅ Write clean, efficient Java solutions

✅ Track progress with learning notes, code, and insights

💻 Language Used
Java (JDK 17)

JUnit for testable logic (optional)

Clean formatting & edge case handling
✅ What I’ve Learned
🧠 Two Pointers: For comparing or shrinking ranges (125, 88, 11, 15)

🔁 Sorting + Deduplication: To avoid redundant results (15)

🪝 Linked List Manipulation: Dummy nodes, fast/slow pointers (19)

💧 Optimization: Thinking beyond brute force (11, 42)

📏 Edge Case Handling: Nulls, single-element lists, boundaries

🔥 Upcoming Goals
Explore: Sliding Window, HashMaps, Stacks

Daily practice on medium/hard-level patterns

Push clean code with comments & test cases
